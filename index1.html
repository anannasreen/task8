        <h2>Style Sheets</h2>
        <p>Style sheet is a list of CSS rules or rule sets</p>
     
    </p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation <br> of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
    (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the <br> World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
    <p> This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the <br> specification of presentation characteristics; 
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, <br> which reduces complexity and repetition in
         the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the <br> pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles <br> for different rendering methods, such as 
    on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. <br> CSS also has rules for alternate formatting 
    if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

    <p>
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one <br> rule matches a particular element.
     This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
    
     <p>
    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) <br> text/css is registered for use with CSS 
    by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>
